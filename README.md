This project was a multi-discipline project with the aim to build a christmas present for my sister.
There are elements of programming, electronics and CAD involved.

A box was created that would play [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) when a button was pressed through a speaker with 8Ω impedence. A disco light would also turn on at the same time, illuminating the room.

In order to use this code, the components used are listed below and a circuit diagram showing how to assemble can be found [here]().
- Arduino Uno
- PAM8302 Amplifier
- 8Ω Speaker (I used one rated for 2W)
- Disco Lights (or any other lamp or appliance)
- 5V Micro SD Card module
- Micro SD Card
- 5V one channel relay module
- Capacitor (10μF used, but 100μF would probably be better).
- Jumper wires


This project could not have been completed without the help of [carlpilot](https://github.com/carlpilot), who 3D printed my design for the casing and aided me in debugging my early prototypes.
